           <h3>I am born in sweden but a lot of my family is from differnt countries so I am 1/4 Italian and Swedish and half Finnish. Even tho 
           I am partially from these countries the only language of the three i speak is swedish. I speak fluent Swedish and English and i can barely
           speak conversational Spanish.
           </h3>
           <h3>I started going to school in Länna Skola in Bergshamra, I only went there for first grade and then moved. After i moved
             I started at Gullhedskolan in Järbo which I went in from 2-6th grade. For 7-9th grade I went to school in Sandviken in a 
             school called Norrsätraskolan and then I decided that I wanted to start doing software development, which is why i ended up here
              at NTI.
