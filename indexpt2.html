            I like playing Videogames and the game i play the most 
            currently is overwatch which i have around 2200 hours on (time in matches, queue times alone are probably another 500 hours). Other games i enjoy
            are the Bioshock series, the Metro series and Fortnite.

            I love history, geography, geopolitics and anything similar to that. I spend a lot of time 
            looking at articles about this to try and gain a better understanding of how the world works.

            Lastly i enjoy all sorts of tech and I spend a decent amount of time hunting down pieces of tech that I find interesting 
            or unique. My room is normally crowded with computer parts ranging from transistors in different trays to GPU's with 
            unique designs. Sometimes the parts i bring home end up as 'showpieces' on shelves or something but a lot of the time i 
            stress test them or built retro computer systems with them to test different things and run experiments on.
